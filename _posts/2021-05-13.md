## What i learnd 
- Javascript loop_for, while
* How to get prime number(it tood a so so long time)

``` javascript
function isPrime(num) {
  let k = ""
  for(let i =2; i <= num; i++){
    
    let j = Math.floor(num/i)
    if(j === num/i){
      k += i
    }
}
 return k===String(num)
}
```  
      ^ this is what i do 
#### and this is what i get from stackoverflow 

``` js
const isPrime = num => {
  for(let i = 2; i < num; i++)
    if(num % i === 0) return false;
  return num > 1;
}

```

#### but at least i think it was meaningful time 
---
- my idea  
  - How can i get the year of the sexagenary circle
   * The sexagenary cycle, also known as the Stems-and-Branches or ganzhi, is a cycle of sixty terms, each corresponding to one year, thus a total of sixty years for one cycle, historically used for reckoning time in China and the rest of the East Asian cultural sphere. -Wikipedia-
   ![The sexagenary circle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Sexagenary_cycle_years_spirals.svg)

  - It just cross my mind so i just made it. 
  but actually it tood about three hours to write this code  
 ``` js
  const Sexagenary = ['갑','을','병','정','무','기','경','신','임','계']
const Zordiac = ['자','축','인','묘','진','사','오','미','신','유','술','해'] 
let New = []
let i = 0;
let j = 0;
do{
  i %=10; j%=12;
  New.push(Sexagenary[i]+Zordiac[j])
  i++; j++;
} while (New.length < 60)

const Cal = (Year)=>{
  const GapJa = 1804 
  let diff=Math.abs(Year - GapJa)%60
  return New[diff]
}
console.log(Cal(2021)+'년')

 ```   
- Good enough or not i am pretty much proud of me!!
