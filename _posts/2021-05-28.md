### scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. so you can access to the stuffs when you need at a time 
---
### Gobal Scope 
- when you start writing Javascript in a document. you are already in the Global scope. There is only one Global scope throughout a javaScript document 
- variables inside the Global scope can be accessed and altered in any other scope

### Local Scope
1. function scope
```js
function(){
    var scope = Local
}

```

2. block scope- if, switch condition or for and while loops, unlike functions, don't create a new scope. Variables defined inside of a block statement will remain in the scope they were already in.
```js
if(true){
    var scope = block
}
console.log(scope)

```
### Lexical Scope 
Lexical Scope means that in a nested group of functions, the inner functions have access to the variables and other resources of their parent scope 
```js
function grandfather(){
    var name = "Hammad";
    //likes is not accessible here
    function parent(){
        //name is accesible here
        //likes is not accessible here
        function child(){
            //innermost level of the scope chain
            // name is alse accessible here
            var likes = "Coding";
        }
    }
}
```
### Closure 
The concept of closures is closely related to Lexical Scope.
**A Clousure can not only access the variables defined in its outer function but also the arguments of the outer function**
```js
function makeFunc(){
    var name ="Mozilla";
    function displayName(){
        alert(name);
    }
    return displayname;
}
var innerfunc = makeFunc();
innerfunc(); // can call inner function displayName()
```
