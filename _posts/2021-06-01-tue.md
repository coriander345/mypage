### What i learnd 
- what is Dom 
 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface. 
- The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. 
- DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree(**CRUD**)

>"The W3C Document Object Model(DOM)is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and script to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
----
- Ex) this code can return a list of all the <p> elements in the document
```js
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
// paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
```
