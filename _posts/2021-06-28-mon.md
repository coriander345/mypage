### BFS
> Queue is a data structure that follows the First-In First-Out(FIFO) approach. 
>  BFS is the way to traverse the graph until it go sown to the farthest node. So basically, using array to mark each vertex that is visited, 
> if we visited the node we want to mark it as true ans then proceed to get all its edges and mark all the vidited vertex
> and repeat it untill we have an empty stack. BFS seems simpler than DFS

1. Enqueue a node, mark as visited.
2. Dequeue (visit) all edges of the node and mark as visited and enqueue.
3. Repeat the process whil queue is not empty.

EX)
```js
const bfs = (node) =>{
    visited[node] = true;
    queue.equeue(node);
    while(!queue.isEmpty()){
        let visiting = queue.dequeue();
        
        for(let i=0; i< graph[node].length; i++){
            if(graph[node][i]===1){
                stack.push(i)
            }
        }
    }
}
