## 1. What i learnd
### today i study with **Codestate**'s program about basic of javascript
### They have nice coding problems like math problems that i already did before so i make it little bit differently and solve it again. 
It was questions that use 'if' statement and i use switch 
```js
function daysInMonth(date) {
  // TODO: 여기에 코드를 작성합니다.
  let d = new Date()
  d.setDate(date)
  let today= d.getDay()
  let j;
  switch(today){
    case 6:
    j= "일요일"
    break;
    case 5:
    j= "토요일"
    break;
    case 4:
    j= "금요일"
    break;
    case 3:
    j= "목요일"
    break;
    case 2:
    j= "수요일"
    break;
    case 1:
    j= "화요일"
    break;
    case 0:
    j= "월요일"
    break;
    default: 
       false
  }
  return j
  }
daysInMonth(15)
``` 
* And i get an idea that you can not use comparison like "<, >" in side of the switch statement 
and \
i try to use "Date things" like New date and i learn so many things from that 
```js
function addOneSecond(hour, minute, second) {

let date = new Date()
date.setHours(hour);
date.setMinutes(minute);
date.setSeconds(second)

return `${date.getHours()} ${date.getMinutes()} ${date.getSeconds()}`
  
}
```

## What i though 
### i thought i really like solving coding problems and i found some coding problems. there are a lot!  so i want to keep solving problems and upgrade my coding skill
