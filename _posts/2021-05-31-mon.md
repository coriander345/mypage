### What i learnd today 
- i used git command "reset" because i pull data from git repository and it replaced my data so i tried "reset" at the first time. 
- actually it was really angry then but i think it was quite good experience for me because i was able to use and learn git command 
- if you want to use "reset" you should type "git log" and check log record, commit message and check log number 
- if you cannot find record which is you want to go back like as i did. you can use "git log -p" 
- it would show you all the difference between each commit
- And be careful when you type "pull" command
