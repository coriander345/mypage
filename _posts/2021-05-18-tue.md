## What i learnd : Pseudo Code
 ### I built calculator with javascript. it was longest code i ever built so i really thought that i need a pseudo code. 
 i found some example of peudo code and how to write \
 One from "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/" was really helpful Thankyou very much \
 I just want to write it down little bit  
 - Do:
 - use control structures
 - use proper naming convention
 - indentation and white spaces are the key 
 - Keep it simple
 - Keep it concise


- Do not 
- Don't make the pseudo code abstract.
- Don't be too generalized

### so if i want to build calculator it would be like this
```js
// i want to build calculator with HTML and Javascript. this calculator has "+", "-","*","/", "AC", "Enter" and numbers 
if(click=== number){
     // it will be saved in firstNumber variable
} 
if(click===operator){
    //display operator
}
if(click===AC){
    //clear
}
if(click===Enter){
    // return resultNumber and if click "Enter" twice or more it will calculate  previous resultNumber and previous secondNumber
}


```
