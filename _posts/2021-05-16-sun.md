# Today 2021-05-16  SUNDAY
## Today i study How to use nested loop it was really complicated and my brain is total messed now but at least i saw some patterns 
## it's similiar with equation like  "x = y and x^2= y " so i mean it can make some graph like i said on my blog last time
### so look at this 
```js
let y=5
let x=5
let str = "";
for(let i = 0; i < y; i++ ){
    for(let j = 0; j <x; j++){
        if(i <= j ){
            str = str.concat(i);
        }else{
            str = str.concat(j)
        }
    }
    str = str.concat("\n")
}
 console.log(str)
```  
### it would be return like this⇩
0 0 0 0 0 \
0 1 1 1 1    
0 1 2 2 2 \
0 1 2 3 3 \
0 1 2 3 4

and this is Equation 5x = 5y⇩

### can you see the smiliarity so i think the first loop decide the length of Y and second loop decide the length of X 
### but if you put one more loop in side of second loop What happen? it could be like X^2 = Y 

this is what i made when i was study. you can see how it spread⇩
```js
function star(y) {
    let str = "";
    for(let i = 0; i < y; i++ ){
        for(let k = 0; k<=i; k++){
        for(let j = 0; j <=i; j++){
            if(i <= j ){
                str = str.concat("*");
            }else{
             str = str.concat(" ")
            }
        }
        }
        str = str.concat("\n")
    }
    console.log(str)
}
star(12)
```

### I recommend you to make this star pattern you can also find it on google
