### What is Linux 
- **Linux** is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
- &nbsp; Developer: **Linus Torvalds**  he is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the main developer of the **Linux kernel**, used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android. He also created the distributed revision control system **Git** and the **scuba dive** logging and planning software **Subsurface.**
- &nbsp;Why Linux: **Linux** is very well secure as it is easy to detect bugs and fix and Linux runs faster even with older hardware whereas windows are slower compared to Linux.
