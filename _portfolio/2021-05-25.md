Js_object
### What i learnd
* object is composed with key and value.
* object is defined like this
```js
var obj ={
    name: "jun"
    age:28
    country: "korea"
}
```
* you can define another key and value even if you defined as a **const**
```js
obj.job = "programmer"
obj["job"]="programmer"
``` 
* you can also access keys of the object like below
 ```js
 object.name
 object["age"]
 console.log(object["age"]) // console: 28
 ``` 
 * if you make a loop with Object you can use **for in**
  ```js
  for(let key in object){
      console.log(key)
      // console: name / age / countery
  }
  ``` 

  ### What i search 
  * An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.)
  * Object property names(keys) are separated by commas
  * You can remove a non-inherited property by using the delete operator. The following code shows how to remove a property.
  * you accessed the object's properties and methods using dot notation.
  * There is another way to access object properties — using bracket notation.
