### What I learnd 
* CSS layout and Selector
* CSS Selector is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match.
 ```css
 h1{
  background-color:#ffcccc ;
  font-size: 2px:
 }
 p{
     color:red;
     text-align:end;
 }
 ```
 in this case Selector is **h1** and **p**
 
 * CSS layout: CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window. 
 * you can practice **Flex box technique** with game as follow
